        	<h1>In 1917, an artist presented a sclpture of a urinal. It was recently sold for 2 million dollars. How did he do it? </h1>


          <div class="contentText">
            <p> <ul> <li>The artist Marcel Duchamp presented an sculpture named Fountain, a porcelain urinal signed "R.Mutt. Duchamp questioned “Can one make works which are not ‘of art’”</li>

<li>After photographing the piece, it was immediately disposed</li>

<li>At the beginning he was dubbed as an “amateur inventor”</li>

<li>But he transformed the meaning of his sculpture Fountain with his own method of distribution </li>

<li>He distributed photographs of the work through various media </li>

<li>Its bluntness intrigued the public. They asked why was this mundane object all over the place?</li>

<li>This raised intrigue </li>

<li>Distribution</li>

<li>It was the thing that played the most with the Fountain;s acquisition of value </li>

 <li>Does one have an obligation to view the work first-hand? </li>

<li>What happens when a more intimate, thoughtful, and enduring understanding comes from mediated discussions of an exhibition, rather than from a direct experience of the work? </li>

<li>Is it incumbent upon the consumer to bear witness, or can one’s art experience derive from magazines, the Internet, books, and conversation?</li>

<li>We should recognize that collective experience is now based on simultaneous private experiences, distributed across the field of media culture, knit together by ongoing debate, publicity, promotion and discussion</li>

<li>The secret?</li>

<blockquote>Distribute an intriguing object as much as you can and its value will rise over time </li></blockquote>
